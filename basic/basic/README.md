##

1. Void = the opposite of "any" type, indicates lack of a type. Are typically adnotated upon functions => when a function returns nothing.

2. Never = a value will never occur.

3. Null and undefined = can be a major source of bugs in our code

4. Nullability 

5. Type aliases = allow us to create custom types in Ts => provide our types with a specific name. Cannot contain values, only types!
eg: 
```
type TSCourse = 'TS';
```

6. Type assertion (Casting) = they are trying to tell Ts that we know more about a specific type than what the Ts might refer.

7. Union types = allow us to type adnotate more than one type to a variable/function parameter. Is the equivalent of or operator but for types. 

8. Literal types = kind of types that extremely strcts our values or the values that a parameter, a function parameter or a variable can accept.

9. Intersection type (&)

10. Function type

11. Optional parameters = kind of parameters whose values are not necessaryly required

12. Default parameters = optional parameters

13. Object type 

14. Literal object type = kind of object types that we directly pass into a function
